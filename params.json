Uses mrepo! \r\n* spacewalk-orgclone-channel -- Clones a channel and its errata to a new channel. This works even if the channel is shared from another organization.\r\n* spacewalk-create-yumrepo -- Creates a yum repository out of an spacewalk channel\r\n* spacewalk-compare-packages -- Compares packages of an host for a different channel to check for updates \r\n* spacewalk-clone-errata -- Clones errata from one channel to another\r\n* spacewalk-remove-old-packages -- Deletes packages without channel OR outdated packages from one channel\r\n* uln-clone-errata -- Fetches errata information for oracles \"unbreakable\" red hat clone and pushes it into spacewalk\r\n   -- Update 20130618: It seems this script is outdated - ULN errata comes with an XML file within the repo and spacewalk-repo-sync honors that file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReadme.md               spacewalk-compare-packages  spacewalk-diff-erratas      spacewalk-remove-old-packages  template\r\nspacewalk-clone-errata  spacewalk-create-yumrepo    spacewalk-orgchannel-clone  spacewalk-rhn-sync             uln-clone-errata\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
